GMG: Geometric multigrid
AMG: Algebraic multigrid

sxamg-master: a AMG toolbox sxamg developed by refactorization of FASP by Dr. Liu.

demo_mumps_poisson_2d: direct solve Poisson equation with MUMPS.

demo_gmg_amg_poisson: implemented my own GMG while calling sxamg for AMG

demo_mg_poisson_1/2/3d: my own implementation of both GMG and AMG. All of them are working nicely.
